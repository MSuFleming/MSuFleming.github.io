<p>Yes! This is a fake website! Everything on the page is fabricated. The content of this assignment is inspired by the <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/">Transfermarket webiste</a>. Some soccer related terms such as contract expires and transfer hsitory are used in this site in order to make it look more professional.</p>
<p>For part 3, three of the six items are chosen to be demonstrated in this assignment, including responsive design, Google Mpas Static API maps and menu.</p>
